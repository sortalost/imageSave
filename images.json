Username is \"maury\" and password is \"123\" for now.\r\n\r\nThe images are saved in a github repo (for this example, its <a href=\"https://github.com/sortalost/temporary/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). You will also need a github token, with just \"repo\" scope - im using mine atm.\r\n\r\nTo have this site on your domain, you will need to fork the repo with this code (its private for now, i'll make it public in a few minutes since my github token was there initially, i have to delete commit history). Then deploy a vercel app and point it to your domain. You can google it, or I'll help you out with that.\r\n\r\nSo, there will be two github repos in total: one for your site's code, another where your images will be stored. Both can be private/public or any combination as such.\r\n\r\nThats it ig?"
